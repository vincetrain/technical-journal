This repository is a collection of notes taken for labs and assignments throughout courses for Seneca Polytechnic's Informatics and Security 4 year bachelor's program. 

Feel free to fork and merge-request your own notes! I would love to have some collaborators to build this repository up as a documented source of information for those in the program.

This repository **will not** contain answers to labs or assignments and rather serves as guidance for concepts that labs or assignments will reference.
